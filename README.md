# Distributed-Microservices-Log-Management-System-With-ELK-Stack-and-Java
This project involves building a scalable, real-time log management system that leverages the ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) stack and extends its capabilities using Java and microservices. The system collects, processes, filters, and analyzes logs at scale, providing insights for troubleshooting and performance monitoring.
